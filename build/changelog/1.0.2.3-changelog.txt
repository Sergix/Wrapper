Changelog entry:

[4/3/2017-19:46 1.0.2.3]
    Created documentation for 1.0.2.2.
    Noticed a large issue in both builds where the wrapper attempts to package the executable, so the fix will be pushed in this update.
    New documentation will not be provided for this fix.
    1.0.2.2 is now DEPRECATED. Check the "Build Targets" section in the updated README.md and in the documentation for build information.
    Fixed a typo in a source build file ("1.0.2.2.zip" => "1.0.2.2-src.zip").
    Pushed update 1.0.2.3 to GitHub.

Full changes include:
    - Fixed a potentially large issue where the wrapping process would attempt to copy the application itself into the outputted wrap file due to a small typo in the wrap() function
    - Fixed the menu to state the actual current version, as it was displaying 1.0.2.1
